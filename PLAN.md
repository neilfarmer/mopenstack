# MockOpenStack (mopenstack) - Project Plan

A mock OpenStack environment for local development and testing, similar to LocalStack for AWS.

## Project Overview

MockOpenStack will provide a lightweight, local implementation of OpenStack APIs that enables developers to:
- Test infrastructure-as-code tools locally
- Develop OpenStack applications without a full deployment
- Simulate OpenStack environments for CI/CD pipelines
- Learn OpenStack APIs without complex setup

## Core OpenStack Services to Implement

### Phase 1 - Essential Services
1. **Keystone (Identity Service)**
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Token management
   - Project/tenant management
   - User and role management

2. **Nova (Compute Service)**
   - Instance lifecycle management (create, start, stop, delete)
   - Flavor management
   - Image references (metadata only)
   - Basic networking attachment

3. **Neutron (Networking Service)**
   - Network creation and management
   - Subnet management
   - Port management
   - Security groups

4. **Glance (Image Service)**
   - Image metadata management
   - Mock image storage (no actual file handling)
   - Image format support simulation

### Phase 2 - Storage and Advanced Services
5. **Cinder (Block Storage)**
   - Volume creation and management
   - Volume attachments to instances
   - Snapshot management

6. **Swift (Object Storage)**
   - Container management
   - Object metadata
   - Basic object operations

### Phase 3 - Additional Services
7. **Octavia (Load Balancer)**
   - Load balancer creation
   - Listener and pool management
   - Health monitoring simulation

8. **Designate (DNS)**
   - Zone management
   - Record management
   - DNS delegation simulation

## Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.9+
- **Framework**: FastAPI for REST API implementation
- **Database**: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL support for production
- **Containerization**: Docker with docker-compose
- **Testing**: pytest with comprehensive test suite

### Core Components

1. **API Gateway**
   - Route requests to appropriate service handlers
   - Handle authentication and authorization
   - Request/response logging and debugging

2. **Service Implementations**
   - Each OpenStack service as a separate module
   - Shared database models and utilities
   - Consistent error handling and responses

3. **Data Layer**
   - SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations
   - Migration system for schema changes
   - In-memory caching for performance

4. **Mock Resource Management**
   - State tracking for all resources
   - Realistic resource relationships
   - Configurable behavior and failures

## Key Features

### Development Experience
- Single command startup (docker-compose up)
- Hot reloading for development
- Comprehensive logging and debugging
- API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)

### OpenStack Compatibility
- Accurate API endpoint structures
- Proper HTTP status codes and error responses
- OpenStack SDK compatibility
- Standard authentication flows

### Testing and Validation
- Comprehensive test suite
- Integration tests with popular IaC tools
- Performance benchmarking
- API compatibility validation

### Configuration and Flexibility
- Configurable service endpoints
- Adjustable resource limits
- Failure injection for testing
- Multiple deployment modes

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
- Project setup and architecture
- Keystone authentication service
- Basic Nova compute operations
- Simple Neutron networking
- Docker containerization

### Phase 2: Core Services (Weeks 5-8)
- Complete Nova implementation
- Full Neutron networking features
- Glance image service
- Cinder block storage
- Integration testing

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 9-12)
- Swift object storage
- Octavia load balancing
- Designate DNS service
- Performance optimization

### Phase 4: Production Ready (Weeks 13-16)
- Comprehensive testing
- Documentation and examples
- CI/CD pipeline
- Performance tuning
- Community feedback integration

## Success Criteria

1. **Functional Compatibility**
   - Terraform OpenStack provider works seamlessly
   - OpenStack CLI tools function correctly
   - Popular SDKs (openstacksdk, shade) compatible

2. **Performance**
   - Fast startup time (< 30 seconds)
   - Responsive API calls (< 100ms for simple operations)
   - Minimal resource usage

3. **Developer Experience**
   - Easy installation and setup
   - Clear documentation and examples
   - Helpful error messages and debugging

4. **Testing Coverage**
   - 90%+ code coverage
   - Integration tests with major IaC tools
   - Comprehensive API validation

## Future Enhancements

- Additional OpenStack services (Barbican, Magnum, etc.)
- Multi-region simulation
- Advanced failure simulation
- Performance metrics and monitoring
- Plugin architecture for custom services
- Web UI for resource management

## Risk Mitigation

- Start with core services to validate approach
- Regular compatibility testing with real tools
- Modular architecture for easy maintenance
- Comprehensive documentation from day one
- Community engagement for feedback and contributions

## Resource Requirements

- Development team: 1-2 developers
- Timeline: 16 weeks for MVP
- Infrastructure: Docker, CI/CD pipeline
- Documentation: Comprehensive user and developer guides
